 * reading object with references fails -> getTask().add or addTask(Task)
 * even try heavy self circular references like so
   class Task { Task parentTask; List<Task> subTasks;}
 * deploy on maven2 repository
 * integrate in timefinder
=> 1.0 alpha, beta, stable

 * check before reading + after writing if xml is correct (against xsd)
 * what happens if there are different versions of classes?
   reading + removed java property => ignore xml element   
   reading + added java property   => init with default value or null
   for writing there is nothing to do

=> 1.1 alpha, beta, stable
