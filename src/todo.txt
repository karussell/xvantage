 * maventests does not pass!
 * test reading with timefinder
 * even try heavy self circular references like so
   class Task { Task parentTask; List<Task> subTasks;}
=> publish to "sf maven" as version=0.8

 * check before reading + after writing if xml is correct (against xsd)
   -> new readObjects + writeOjects with additional xsd argument
 * what happens if there are different versions of classes?
   reading + removed java property => ignore xml element   
   reading + added java property   => init with default value or null
   for writing there is nothing to do
