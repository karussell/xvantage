=> publish to "sf maven" as version=0.8

 * instead setter/getter use field => instead ignoreMethod use transient
 * maventests does not pass! -> cannot find resources?
 * check before reading + after writing if xml is correct (against xsd)
   -> new readObjects + writeOjects with additional xsd argument
 * what happens if there are different versions of classes?
   reading + removed java property => ignore xml element   
   reading + added java property   => init with default value or null
   for writing there is nothing to do
