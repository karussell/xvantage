 * Serializable -> private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream oos)
                   private void readObject(ObjectInputStream oos)
                -> see SerializableObject
 * BeanInfo + PropertyDescriptor instead pure reflection?
   Apache BeanUtils to clone beans!
 * xvantage.putParsing(WeekRasterImpl.class, new Parsing() {...})
   xvantage.putParsing(WeekRaster.class, new Parsing() {...})
   only the latter one should be necessary
 * xvantage.setDefaultImplementation(Map.class, FastMap.class);
   -> set alias to the one of Map.class
 * collection parsing: if no setter for fieldA and getCollFieldA != null use a = getCollFieldA instead a = collClazz.newInstance
   or even addFieldA !
 * instead setter/getter use field
 * instead ignoreMethod use transient
 * maventests does not pass! -> cannot find resources?
 * check before reading + after writing if xml is correct (against xsd)
   -> new readObjects + writeOjects with additional xsd argument
 * what happens if there are different versions of classes?
   reading + removed java property => ignore xml element   
   reading + added java property   => init with default value or null
   for writing there is nothing to do
